**NES 2.0 Mapper 454** denotes the PCB (with unknown ID code) of a *110-in-1* multicart consisting of NROM games in the first 512 KiB and UNROM games in the second 512 KiB, and where PRG A19 selects between NROM and UNROM banking modes. It can be considered a custom implementation of [INES Mapper 227](../INES_Mapper_227/).
