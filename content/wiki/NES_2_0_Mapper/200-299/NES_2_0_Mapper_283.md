NES 2.0 Mapper 283 is used for the *Block Family 6-in-1/7-in-1* multicarts. Its UNIF board name is **BMC-GS-2004** (additional 8 KiB PRG-ROM chip present) and **BMC-GS-2013** (no additional 8 KiB PRG-ROM chip present).

# Banks {#Banks}

- CPU \$6000-\$7FFF: 8 KiB PRG-ROM bank, fixed to last 8 KiB bank within the first 256 KiB block, or if present, to the content of an additional 8 KiB PRG-ROM chip.
- CPU \$8000-\$FFFF: 32 KiB switchable PRG-ROM bank.
- PPU \$0000-\$1FFF: 8 KiB of CHR-RAM.

# Data Latch {#Data_Latch}

- CPU \$8000-\$FFFF: Select 32 KiB PRG-ROM bank at CPU \$8000-\$FFFF.

# Notes {#Notes}

- Mirroring is fixed and denoted in the NES header.
- The 8 KiB PRG-ROM chip is present and located in the very last PRG-ROM bank if the number of PRG-ROM banks is a power of two *plus one*. Its data is repeated once since the iNES format only allows for 16 KiB PRG-ROM banks.
