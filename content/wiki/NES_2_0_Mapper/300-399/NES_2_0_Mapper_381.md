**NES 2.0 Mapper 381** denotes the **KN-42** PCB, used by the *2-in-1 High Standard Game (BC-019)* reset-based multicart containing two (modified) [UOROM](../UxROM/) games, in this case, the two Codemasters "Bignose" titles.

The actual 16 KiB bank number is therefore *aaab*. PRG A14..A17 are forced to \$F if CPU A14=1, just like UOROM. PRG A18 is flipped on each reset cycle, which is detected through interruption of the M2 signal. The data latch exhibits bus conflicts.
