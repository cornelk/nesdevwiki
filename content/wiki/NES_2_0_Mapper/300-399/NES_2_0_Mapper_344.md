- WRAM must be enabled in \$A001.7 before writing to this register.
- The inner PRG bank is restricted to 128 KiB.
- NROM mode PRG forces MMC3's CPU A13 and A14 inputs to GND and replaces MMC3's PRG A13 output with CPU A13. This means that MMC3 bank register 6 bits 1-3 provide PRG A14..A16 for the entire CPU \$8000-\$FFFF range.
- The common dump of *快打金卡终极挑战 (Kuàidǎ Jīnkǎ Zhōngjí Tiǎozhàn) 3/6-in-1* has the 128 KiB PRG-ROM banks mixed-up, correct would be in the order 0, 3, 1, 2.
- Depending on whether a solder pad is connected, setting the S bit may disable PRG-ROM. The menu sets this bit to select between two different game counts.
