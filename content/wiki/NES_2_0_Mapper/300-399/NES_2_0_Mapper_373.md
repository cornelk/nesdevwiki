NES 2.0 Mapper 373 is used for a *Super 4-in-1* multicart (PCB ID **SFC-13**). It is [INES Mapper 045](../INES_Mapper_045/) but with one bit of outer bank register \#2 working as a GNROM switch.

      |||| ++++- Select number of CHR bits from MMC3
      ||||       ($F: 256 KiB, $E: 128 KiB ... $7-$0: 1 KiB)
      |||+------ Select CHR A18
      ||+------- Select MMC3 (0)/GNROM-like (1) PRG mode
      ++-------- Select CHR A20-A21 and PRG A21-22

In GNROM-like mode, the MMC3 clone's CPU A14 input is held low, so that MMC3 registers \#6 and \#7 apply both to \$8000/\$C000 and \$A000/\$E000, with the bank number ANDed with NOT \$02 in the lower range and ORed with \$02 in the upper range.
