**iNES Mapper 242** denotes an address-latch-based multicart circuit board mounting 512 KiB of PRG-ROM plus 8 KiB of unbanked CHR-RAM. A variant used by Chinese RPGs from Waixing adds 8 KiB battery-backed WRAM and does not implement the UNROM-like bankswitching modes. Its UNIF MAPR is **UNL-43272**.

A variant of this PCB (PCB code **ET-113**) adds provisions for a second PRG-ROM chip that is always 128 KiB in size and that contains a replacement menu plus one or two replacement games for the first 512 KiB PRG-ROM chip that contained a menu of its own, resulting in a non-power-of-two 640 KiB of PRG-ROM. The chip select logic is implemented such that the replacement chip is banked-in on power-on/reset.

- On multicart PCBs (no PRG-RAM/battery), CHR-RAM is write-protected when O=1 and write-enabled when O=0, i.e. write-protected in the NROM-128 and NROM-256 modes.
- When the *m* bit is set, PRG A4-A0 are replaced with the values of five solder pads, which when the menu code reads particular ROM locations effectively selects one of up to 32 menus with different game counts.
- Because all bits are cleared on reset, both CPU \$8000-\$BFFF and \$C000-\$FFFF are set to 16 KiB bank \#0 on reset.
