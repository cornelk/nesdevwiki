iNES Mapper 159 is used for [Bandai FCG](../Bandai_FCG_board/) boards with an [LZ93D50 ASIC](../Bandai_LZ93D50_pinout/) and a 128-byte serial EEPROM (X24C01). The 128 bytes must be denoted as PRG-NVRAM in the [NES 2.0](../NES_2.0/) header using byte value \$10.

# Registers {#Registers}

All registers function the same way as [INES Mapper 016](../INES_Mapper_016/), submapper 5, except that the serial EEPROM is not a 24C02 but Xicor's X24C01. This EEPROM has operational differences compared to both the larger 24C02 and other vendors' 24C01. Bandai's developers consistently thought the X24C01 was a little-endian device, and their code clocks in address and data bytes assuming this. However, it's actually a big-endian device, and a multi-byte read or write from EEPROM will increment the address accordingly.
