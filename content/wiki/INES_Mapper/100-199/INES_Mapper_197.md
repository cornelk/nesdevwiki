iNES Mapper 197 denotes an [MMC3](../MMC3/) clone wired to support 512 KiB of CHR-ROM by increasing CHR banking granularity from 1/2 KiB to 2/4 KiB. All of its games are mapper hacks, usually by 卡聖 (Kǎshèng, NT-xxx cartridge codes), of games originally released on mappers [90](../J.Y._Company_ASIC/) and [91](../INES_Mapper_091/). Submappers, assigned by Nestopia Plus!, denote three different wiring variants. PRG-ROM, nametable mirroring and IRQs function as in mapper [4](../MMC3/).

## Submapper 0 {#Submapper_0}

- *Super Fighter III* (PRG-ROM CRC32 0xC333F621), originally for Mapper [91](../INES_Mapper_091/).1.

## Submapper 3 {#Submapper_3}

- *1995 Super 2-in-1 (2B20)*

Like Submapper 0, but with an additional outer bank register at \$6000-\$7FFF:

    Mask: $E000

    D~7654 3210
      ---------
      .... S..P
           |  +- PRG A17 if S=1
           +---- PRG A17 mode
                  0: PRG A17=MMC3 PRG A17 (256 KiB)
                  1: PRG A17=P (128 KiB)

As the outer bank register uses the MMC3 clone's WRAM interface, writes only have an effect if WRAM is enabled and not write-protected via \$A001.
