iNES Mapper 063 is used for NTDEC's "Powerful 250-in-1" multicart (PCB ID **TH2291-3**) and its pirate-of-a-pirate equivalent, the "Hello Kitty 255-in-1" (PCB ID **CH-011**) multicart (Submapper 0), as well as the **82AB** PCB used by a *82-in-1* multicart (Submapper 1). The address-latch-based bankswitching hardware supports only NROM-128 and NROM-256 games. CHR data is stored in 8 KiB of unbanked CHR-RAM that can be write-protected.

For the menu code to correctly detect the number of games, selecting unpopulated PRG-ROM banks must result in open bus rather than wrapped addresses.

Compared to Submapper 0, Submapper 1 can be thought as having one PRG-ROM bit less, and moving the CHR-RAM Protect bit into its place.
