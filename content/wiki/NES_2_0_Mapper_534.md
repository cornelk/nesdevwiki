iNES/NES 2.0 Mappers **126**, **422** and **534** denote circuit boards using the [MMC3](../MMC3/)-based **TEC9719**, **ING003C** and **ING-022** ASICs. Four additional outer bank registers are provided at \$6000-\$7FFF for multicart use, overlaying WRAM. They can only be written to if the WRAM bit is enabled in the MMC3 (\$A001=\$80). Clearing the WRAM bit does *not* disable WRAM itself.

According to its datasheet, the ASIC can address up to 4 MiB of PRG ROM, while CHR ROM/RAM capacity is still limited to 256 KiB. Some cartridges mount more CHR ROM than that, repurposing higher PRG address lines as higher CHR address lines for that purpose. Mapper **126** differs from mappers **422** and **534** in which repurposed higher PRG address lines are used for which higher CHR address lines. This implies that in the absence of more than 256 KiB of CHR ROM or when using CHR RAM, mappers 126 and 422 are identical.

Mapper **534** differs from mappers **126** and **422** in the implementation of the MMC3's scanline counter. Mappers 126 and 422 implement it normally, while mapper **534** takes the *inverted* (XOR \$FF) \$C000 value (**ING-022** behavior).

A few circuit boards mount two PRG ROM chips and select between them outside of the normal addressing scheme. Two NES 2.0 Submappers denote this non-contiguous address space:

- **Submapper 1** uses PRG A21 as a chip select between two 1 MiB chips.
- **Submapper 2** uses \$6001 bit 2 as a chip select between two 1 MiB chips.

Two UNIF board names have been assigned that resemble mapper 422: **BMC-BS-400R** and **BMC-BS-4040R**.

Bit 5 (b) is *inverted* before being output to the respective ASIC pin. Because the register is set to \$00 on reset, this means that in the case of 4 MiB of PRG ROM, the cartridge boots in the second 2 MiB half. Older dumps do not take this inversion into account.

The DCBA bits determine ...

1.  what is being fed to the MMC3 clone's CPU A13 and A14 inputs when \$8000-\$FFFF is being written to, in order to replicate the UNROM/ANROM latch being reachable across the entire \$8000-\$FFFF address range;
2.  what is being fed to the MMC3 clone's CPU A13 and A14 inputs when \$8000-\$FFFF is being read from, in order to disable the MMC3's fixed banks in NROM and ANROM modes, or to obtain one switchable 16 KiB instead of two switchable 8 KiB banks in UNROM mode;
3.  how the MMC3 clone's PRG A17..A13 outputs are shifted to switch 16 or 32 KiB banks, instead of 8 KiB banks, in UNROM/ANROM modes;
4.  how the MMC3 clone's PRG A14..A13 outputs are substituted to create UNROM, ANROM, NROM-128 and NROM-256 modes.

In PRG Banking Modes \$8-\$F (bit D=1), CPU A0 is forced to 1 during writes to \$8000-\$FFFF, meaning that only the odd-numbered MMC3 registers are available. Furthermore, in modes D and F (bits D,C,A=1), CPU A13 and CPU A14 are forced to 0 during writes to \$8000-\$FFFF, meaning that any write actually goes to \$8001, which after having set \$8000 to 6 before, makes MMC3 register 6 serve as an UNROM/ANROM latch.

This results in the following modes:
