**NES 2.0 Mapper 406** is used for the homebrew game *Haradius Zero*. It is basically a homebrew [TLROM](../TxROM/) circuit board that connects the [MMC3](../MMC3/)'s address lines differently, and saves the high score to flash ROM. The game executes the flash ROM chip's "Software ID" command; if the manufacturer and model ID do not match the expected values, or it detects that WRAM exists, the game replaces the first level with an unwinnable boss fight.

**Submapper 0** denotes the 60-pin release of the game (saying "AXR" at the bottom of the title screen). The MMC3's A0 input is actually connected to CPU A1, so that \$8000/\$8002 rather than \$8000/\$8001 are differentiated. The Flash ROM chip is a Macronix MX29F040 (manufacturer ID=\$C2, model ID=\$A4).

**Submapper 1** denotes the 72-pin release of the game (saying "INL" at the bottom of the title screen). The MMC3's \$8xxx and \$Exxx registers are swapped, so that \$8000/\$8001 enables/disable IRQ generation, and \$E000/\$E001 write to bank registers. The Flash ROM chip is an AMD AM29F040 (manufacturer ID=\$01, model ID=\$A4).
