NES 2.0 Mapper 383 denotes J.Y. Company's **YY840708C** circuit board. It consists of an AX5202P MMC3 clone together with a 16V8 PAL. It is used for only one known multicart:

- *1995 Soccer 6-in-1 足球小将專輯* (JY-014)

The PAL maintains four signals for bankswitching and responds both to reads and writes:

- **PAL PRG A15**: Set by writing to CPU \$8000-\$FFFF.
- **PAL PRG A16**: Set by reading from CPU \$8000-\$BFFF while **PAL PRG A17/A18** are 0,
- **PAL PRG/CHR A17**: Set by writing to CPU \$8000-\$FFFF.
- **PAL PRG/CHR A18**: Set by writing to CPU \$8000-\$FFFF.

    Mask: $8100

This register overlays the MMC3's registers in the same address range.

Mask: \$C000

When reading from the CPU \$8000-\$BFFF area while **PAL PRG/CHR A17/A18** are zero, **PAL PRG A16** is updated with the MMC3 clone's MMC3 PRG A16 output.

## Effective PRG-ROM banks {#Effective_PRG-ROM_banks}

The four PAL signals not only provide additional address bits, but also modify the masking of other address bits and which 8 KiB CPU bank the MMC3 clone sees. The following table shows how the 8 KiB PRG-ROM bank coming from the MMC3 clone is first ANDed and then ORed depending on the PAL PRG signals and the CPU bank (all \$xx numbers represent 8 KiB bank numbers):

      PAL PRG      CPU      MMC3
    ------------           ------
    A17/A18  A16   Bank*    AND   OR
    ---------------------- ------ ---------------
    $00      $00   **       $03   A15|A16|A17|A18
    $00      $08   **       $07       A16|A17|A18
    $10/$20  -     **       $0F           A17|A18
    $30      -     $6->$E   $0B           A17|A18
    $30      -     $8->$C   $0F           A17|A18
    $30      -     $A->$E   $0F           A17|A18
    $30      -     $C->$8   $0F           A17|A18
    $30      -     $E->$A   $0F           A17|A18

    *  CPU banks to which this applies, and which CPU bank the MMC3 clone sees.
    ** Applies to all CPU banks, which are input to the MMC3 clone unchanged.

Therefore, **PAL PRG/CHR A17/A18** not only select a 128 KiB outer bank, but also select one of three bankswitching modes:

- Setting 0 provides a round-about means of dividing the first 128 KiB bank into two 32 KiB and one 64 KiB bank. **PAL PRG A16** is updated with the content of the corresponding MMC3 PRG bank bit by *reading* from the respective address range, which in turn will then be applied across the *entire* ROM address range. The content of this bit furthermore selects two bankswitching sub-modes:
  - When clear, the MMC3 only selects *within* one of the two 32 KiB banks of the first 64 KiB half of 128 KiB bank \#0, which one is decided by **PAL PRG A15**. This is used for the CNROM/NROM-256 games *Power Soccer* and Nintendo's *Soccer*.
  - When set, the MMC3 selects *within* the second 64 KiB bank of 128 KiB bank \#0. This is used for the game *Tecmo World Cup Soccer* (renamed "Goal 5").
- Settings 1 and 2 provide normal 128 KiB MMC3 banking, used for the games *Kunio-kun no Nekketsu Soccer League* (renamed "Goal 3") and *Nekketsu Koukou Dodgeball Bu - Soccer Hen* (renamed "Heroes Soccer").
- Setting 3 provides 128 KiB MMC3 banking with the CPU A14 line fed to the MMC3 clone reversed. This is used for the game *Tecmo Cup: Soccer Game* (renamed "Tecmo Cup Soccer"), originally an MMC1 game with the fixed bank at \$8000-\$BFFF and the switchable bank at \$C000-\$FFFF, a configuration that could not be reproduced with an MMC3 alone. It is also used for the menu, which in part executes from PRG-ROM mapped to the CPU \$6000-\$7FFF address range on the MMC3 clone's fixed banks alone, as no MMC3 PRG bank register is written to before JMPing to this address range.
