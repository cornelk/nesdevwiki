iNES Mapper 033 represents [Taito's TC0190](../Taito_TC0190_pinout/). It also represents a subset of [Taito's TC0350](../Taito_TC0350_pinout/), but the only game we currently know to have used that IC ( [Don Doko Don](https://nescartdb.com/profile/view/4025/don-doko-don) ) didn't use its interrupt abilities (which are identical to those described on [iNES Mapper 048](../INES_Mapper_048/)).

     Here are Disch's original notes:
     ========================
     =  Mapper 033          =
     ========================

     Example Games:
     --------------------------
     Akira
     Bakushou!! Jinsei Gekijou
     Don Doko Don
     Insector X

     Note:
     --------------------------
     Most dumps of mapper 048 games floating around are erroneously labelled as mapper 033.  Mapper 033 does not
     have IRQs, mapper 048 does, and mirroring on each is handled a bit differently.  Apart from that, the two
     are very similar.

     Registers:
     --------------------------

     Range,Mask:   $8000-BFFF, $A003

       $8000 [.MPP PPPP]
         M = Mirroring (0=Vert, 1=Horz)
         P = PRG Reg 0 (8k @ $8000)

       $8001 [..PP PPPP]   PRG Reg 1 (8k @ $A000)
       $8002 [CCCC CCCC]   CHR Reg 0 (2k @ $0000)
       $8003 [CCCC CCCC]   CHR Reg 1 (2k @ $0800)
       $A000 [CCCC CCCC]   CHR Reg 2 (1k @ $1000)
       $A001 [CCCC CCCC]   CHR Reg 3 (1k @ $1400)
       $A002 [CCCC CCCC]   CHR Reg 4 (1k @ $1800)
       $A003 [CCCC CCCC]   CHR Reg 5 (1k @ $1C00)

     PRG Setup:
     ---------------------------

           $8000   $A000   $C000   $E000  
         +-------+-------+-------+-------+
         | $8000 | $8001 | { -2} | { -1} |
         +-------+-------+-------+-------+

     CHR Setup:
     ---------------------------

           $0000   $0400   $0800   $0C00   $1000   $1400   $1800   $1C00 
         +---------------+---------------+-------+-------+-------+-------+
         |     $8002     |     $8003     | $A000 | $A001 | $A002 | $A003 |
         +---------------+---------------+-------+-------+-------+-------+

Note that unlike the MMC3, the value written for the two 2 KiB CHR banks do not drop the LSB; the number written specifies the offset into CHR as a multiple of 2 KiB. Furthermore, it turns out the MSB of the register is implemented (even if no games ever used it) and the two 2 KiB CHR banks can address a full 512 KiB of CHR. (The four 1 KiB CHR banks are limited to the first 256 KiB of CHR)

The TC0190 also showed up in a few arcade games using [Taito's F2 hardware](https://github.com/mamedev/mame/blob/master/src/mame/taito/taito_f2.cpp#L57).
