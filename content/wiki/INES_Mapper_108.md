**NES 2.0 Mapper 108** denotes at least four different PCBs used for FDS-to-cartridge conversions. All have nametable mirroring hard-wired.

# Submapper 1: DH-08 {#Submapper_1:_DH-08}

Used by Whirlwind Manu's first release of Taito's *Bubble Bobble* (LH31), and is a modified version of Kaiser's cartridge conversion, originally for [INES Mapper 142](../INES_Mapper_142/).

Banks:

- CPU \$6000-\$7FFF: Switchable 8 KiB bank
- CPU \$8000-\$FFFF: Fixed to last 32 KiB of PRG-ROM
- PPU \$0000-\$1FFF: Unbanked 8 KiB CHR-RAM

Registers:

- CPU \$F000-\$FFFF: Select 8 KiB PRG-ROM bank at CPU \$6000-\$7FFF. The game retains writes outside this address range, which must be ignored for the game not to crash.

# Submapper 2 {#Submapper_2}

Used by Whirlwind Manu's later release of Taito's *Bubble Bobble* (LH31) that replaces CHR-RAM with CHR-ROM. UNIF board name is **UNL-BB**.

Banks:

- CPU \$6000-\$7FFF: Switchable 8 KiB bank
- CPU \$8000-\$FFFF: Fixed to last 32 KiB of PRG-ROM
- PPU \$0000-\$1FFF: Switchable 8 KiB CHR-ROM bank

Registers:

- CPU \$E000-\$FFFF: Select 8 KiB PRG-ROM bank at CPU \$6000-\$7FFF \*and\* 8 KiB CHR-ROM bank at PPU \$0000-\$1FFF. The game retains writes outside this address range, which must be ignored for the game not to crash.

# Submapper 3 {#Submapper_3}

Submapper 1 but with the PRG-ROM switch responding in the full CPU \$8000-\$FFFF address range, which is required for both games to function:

- *Falsion* (LH54)
- *Meikyuu Jiin Dababa* (LH28)

Banks:

- CPU \$6000-\$7FFF: Switchable 8 KiB bank
- CPU \$8000-\$FFFF: Fixed to last 32 KiB of PRG-ROM
- PPU \$0000-\$1FFF: Unbanked 8 KiB CHR-RAM

Registers:

- CPU \$8000-\$FFFF: Select 8 KiB PRG-ROM bank at CPU \$6000-\$7FFF

# Submapper 4 {#Submapper_4}

Like Submapper 2, but with the CHR-ROM switch responding in the full CPU \$8000-\$FFFF address range, and PRG-ROM banks being fixed. UNIF board name is *also* **UNL-BB**.

- *Pro Wrestling* (LE05)

Banks:

- CPU \$6000-\$7FFF: 8 KiB bank, fixed to last 8 KiB
- CPU \$8000-\$FFFF: Fixed to last 32 KiB of PRG-ROM
- PPU \$0000-\$1FFF: Switchable 8 KiB CHR-ROM bank

Registers:

- CPU \$8000-\$FFFF: Select 8 KiB CHR-ROM bank at PPU \$0000-\$1FFF

# Heuristics {#Heuristics}

FCEUX and Mesen manage to emulate all four PCBs without disambiguation by heuristically considering the addresses that all games write to:

    if((addr & 0x9000) == 0x8000 || addr >= 0xF000){
        //A version of Bubble Bobble expects writes to $F000+ to switch the PRG banks
        _prgReg = _chrReg = value;
    } else {
        //For ProWres
        _chrReg = value & 0x01;
    }

To disambiguate the four different PCBs in advance:

- CHR-RAM -\> Submappers 1 or 3
  - Horizontal Mirroring -\> Submapper 1, otherwise 3
- CHR-ROM -\> Submappers 2 or 4
  - More than 16 KiB of CHR-ROM -\> Submapper 2, otherwise 4
