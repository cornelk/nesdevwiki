The scrambled addresses correspond to the real address as follows:

    $5007  -------------address written-----------
    value   8000 8001 A000 A001 C000 C001 E000 E001
    ----------------------------------------------- 
    0   8000 8001 A000 A001 C000 C001 E000 E001
    1   A001 A000 8000 C000 8001 C001 E000 E001
    2   8000 8001 A000 A001 C000 C001 E000 E001
    3   C001 8000 8001 A000 A001 E001 E000 C000

    7   8000 8001 A000 A001 C000 C001 E000 E001

The data that is written to the low three bits of register \$8000 corresponds to the real data as follows:

    $5007  -value written-
    value   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
    -----------------------
    0   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
    1   0 2 6 1 7 3 4 5
    2   0 5 4 1 7 2 6 3
    3   0 6 3 7 5 2 4 1
    4   0 2 5 3 6 1 7 4
    5   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
    6   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
    7   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 

Bits 6 and 7 of register \$8000 are kept as they are. The data written to \$8001 and \$A000-\$FFFF is never scrambled. After unscrambling the address and the data written, these registers function the same as the MMC3's

# Note {#Note}

- Several single-game cartridges that use this mapper are actually 2-in-1 multicarts that have PRG A18 forced to 0 or 1 via solder pad. A dump from these cartridges without changing the solder pad will therefore contain 256 KiB of PRG-ROM but 512 KiB of CHR-ROM, since CHR A18 is not forced in a similar fashion, with one 256 KiB half containing data from the other inaccessible game.
- The Outer Bank Register is reset to its power-up value if a Reset has been detected via an interruption of the M2 signal. This makes it difficult to dump these cartridges using a Kazzo device.
- *Boogerman* ([INES Mapper 114](../INES_Mapper_114/) Submapper 1) was originally assigned by CaH4e3 to Mapper 215; he later reassigned **UNL-8237** to Mapper 215 instead.
- Some multicarts may have alternative outer bank registers in the \$6xxx range; since they all contain compatibility code that writes to the \$5xxx range, they are assigned to Mapper 215 as well.

- [NES 2.0 Mapper 258](../NES_2.0_Mapper_258/) adds readable protection registers in the \$5000-\$5007 range.
