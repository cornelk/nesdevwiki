**NES 2.0 Mapper 461** denotes the **CM-9309** PCB, used for the *6-in-1 Wuzi Gun* [MMC1](../MMC1/)-based multicart, consisting of the two MMC1 games *Operation Wolf* and *Mechanized Attack* plus four NROM-128 games. There is one 256 KiB CHR ROM chip and one 32 KiB CHR ROM chip, with the 256 KiB one being stored first in the .NES file.

                             1: 64 KiB inner PRG bank in MMC1 mode (for Mechanized Attack)

This register connects to the MMC1's WRAM interface. The MMC1 clone mimics an MMC1A, so the WRAM interface cannot be disabled. The MMC1's registers select mirroring as well as 128 KiB PRG and 128 KiB CHR banks
