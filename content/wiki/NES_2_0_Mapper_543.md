NES 2.0 Mapper 543 denotes the unmarked printed circuit board of the 1996 無敵智カ卡 5-in-1 (CH-501) multicart. It has 2 MiB of PRG-ROM, 2x32 KiB of battery-backed PRG-RAM, and 32 KiB (8 KiB used) of CHR-RAM. Bankswitching is provided by an AX5904 [MMC1](../MMC1/) clone connected in [SOROM](../MMC1/) or [SNROM](../MMC1/) configurations, plus an additional PAL providing outer bank switching functionality. The circuit board has provisions for additional 2 MiB of PRG-ROM and a third battery-backed 32 KiB PRG-RAM chip.

The outer bank register is similar to the MMC1 registers in that it expects the four-bit bank number as serial data, with the lowest bit sent first. Unlike the MMC1's serial register, there does not seem to be a means of resetting the shift register, and its width is four bits instead of five. It selects the upper PRG-ROM address lines and SRAM chips as follows:

      |||+- PRG A18, SRAM #1 A14, SRAM #2 A13
      ||+-- PRG A19, SRAM #1 (bit clear)/#2 (bit set) chip select
      |+--- PRG A20, SRAM #2 A14
      +---- 1 during game-play, 0 during menu

- MMC1 CHR A15 is connected to SRAM \#1 A13.
- Because the two SRAM chips are connected differently, PRG A19 implicitly selects between SOROM (0) and SNROM (1) configurations.
- Since both SRAM chips are battery-backed, the original SOROM distinction between a volatile and non-volatile 8 KiB bank does not apply here.

This means that games \$08 and \$09 use the [SOROM](../MMC1/) configuration, with the MMC1's CHR A15 output selecting between two inner 8 KiB banks, and PRG A18 selecting between two outer 16 KiB banks in the first 32 KiB SRAM chip. Games \$0A, \$0B, \$0E and \$0F use the [SNROM](../MMC1/) configuration, with the MMC1's CHR A15 output ignored, and PRG A18 and A20 selecting four outer 8 KiB banks in the second 32 KiB SRAM chip. Games \$0C and \$0D would use the same save RAM space as games \$08 and \$09 and are therefore invalid and unused by the cartridge.
