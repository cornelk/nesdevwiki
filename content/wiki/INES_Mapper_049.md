Here are Disch's original notes:

     ========================

     Example Game:
     --------------------------
     Super HIK 4-in-1

     Notes:
     ---------------------------

     Yet another MMC3 multicart.  For info on MMC3, see mapper 004.

     There is no PRG-RAM.  The multicart reg lies at $6000-7FFF, but is only writable when MMC3 PRG-RAM is enabled
     and writable (see $A001)

     Registers:
     ---------------------------

       $6000-7FFF:  [BBPP ...O]  Multicart reg
            B = Block
            P = 32k PRG Reg
            O = PRG Mode (0=32k mode)

       $8000-FFFF:  Same as MMC3 for selected block

     Each block is 128k PRG and 128k CHR

     PRG Setup:
     ---------------------------

       When the 'O' mode bit is clear, ordinary MMC3 PRG regs are ignored, and instead, 32k PRG page 'P' is swapped
     in at $8000.  When 'O' is set, 'P' is ignored, and MMC3 PRG regs work normally for the current block.

     Powerup:
     ---------------------------

     $6000 set to 0 on powerup.
