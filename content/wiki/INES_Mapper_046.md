This mapper represents the [Rumble Station](http://community.fandom.com/wiki/c:bootleggames:Rumble_Station), a combined NES-on-a-Chip and multicart of licensed [Color Dreams](../Color_Dreams/) games. The outer mapper, selecting 64K CHR ROM banks (bits 7-4) and 64K PRG ROM banks (bits 3-0), is at \$6000-\$7FFF, and the inner mapper is a size-reduced subset of Color Dreams (#11). Together, this supports up to 1 MB PRG ROM and 1 MB CHR ROM.

     Here are Disch's original notes:

     Example Game:
     --------------------------
     Rumblestation 15-in-1

     Bus Conflicts?:
     ---------------------------
     No idea whether or not this mapper suffers from bus conflicts.  Use caution!

     Registers:
     ---------------------------

     Regs at $6000-7FFF means no PRG-RAM.

       $6000-7FFF:  [CCCC PPPP]   High CHR, PRG bits
       $8000-FFFF:  [.CCC ...P]   Low CHR, PRG bits

     'C' selects 8k CHR @ $0000
     'P' select 32k PRG @ $8000

     Powerup:
     ---------------------------
     $6000 set to 0 on powerup.

Nestopia and FCEUX reset both registers, not just the outer bank.
