iNES Mapper 143 denotes an NROM circuit board with a simple form of protection:

- *Dancing Blocks*
- *Magical Mathematics* (NTSC version only)

The functional description is consistent with a [74138](../74138/) and a 74368.

Reads from these addresses produce this output:

    A:[010. ...1 ..DD DDDD] -> [xxii iiii]
                   || ||||      |||| ||||
                   ++-++++------||++-++++-- reads provide the logical inversion of DDDDDD in the bits iiiiii
                                ++--------- open bus

Nestopia additionally implies that at least *Dancing Blocks* relies extensively on the values of uninitialized memory, and so manually sets the emulated console's 2K of internal RAM to a different pattern than Nestopia's default.
