**NES 2.0 Mapper 401** denotes the **KC885** multicart circuit board, used for the *Super 19-in-1* (VIP19) multicart. It is basically [mapper 45](../INES_Mapper_045/) with the higher address lines connected weirdly.

- PRG A13-A17: from \$6000 \#1 bits 0-4, same as mapper 45
- PRG A18: either from \$6000 \#2 bit 5 or from \$6000 \#1 bit 6, depending on solder pad setting
- PRG A19: either from \$6000 \#2 bit 6 or from \$6000 \#1 bit 5, depending on solder pad setting
- PRG /CE: \$6000 \#1 bit 7, if solder pad connected

The menu code tries the two ways of selecting PRG A18 and A19 and whether \$6000 \#1 bit 7 disables PRG-ROM, and selects one of eight different menus based on what it finds. Other multicarts using mapper 45's chipset do the same thing; KC885 is unique in that the standard mapper 45 way of connecting PRG-ROM will not work at all.
