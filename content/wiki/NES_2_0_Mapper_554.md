**NES 2.0 Mapper 554** denotes the Kaiser **KS-7010** circuit board, used for one of several cartridge conversions of the FDS version of *悪魔城 Dracula*, the Japanese version of *Castlevania*. Bankswitching is unusual in being triggered entirely through *reads* from "magic" addresses. The board mounts 128 KiB PRG-ROM, 128 KiB CHR-ROM, a KS-201 ASIC and a 74'32.

# Banks {#Banks}

- CPU \$6000-\$7FFF: Switchable 8 KiB PRG-ROM bank
- CPU \$8000-\$9FFF: Fixed 8 KiB PRG-ROM bank \#10
- CPU \$A000-\$BFFF: Fixed 8 KiB PRG-ROM bank \#11
- CPU \$C000-\$DFFF: Fixed 8 KiB PRG-ROM bank \#6
- CPU \$E000-\$FFFF: Fixed 8 KiB PRG-ROM bank \#7
- PPU \$0000-\$1FFF: Switchable 8 KiB CHR-ROM bank
- Nametable mirroring: hard-wired (to vertical)

# Bankswitching Reads {#Bankswitching_Reads}

The 8 KiB PRG-ROM bank at \$6000, and the 8 KiB CHR-ROM bank, are both switched to the same bank number whenever certain addresses are read from.
