**NES 2.0 Mapper 436** denotes the **ZLX-08** plug-and-play VT02 console PCB, used by the *Entertainment System 620-in-1* plug-and-play console. It is uses normal [OneBus banking](../NES_2.0_Mapper_256/), with one exception: the VT02's PRG A23 output (register \$4100 bit 6 for PRG and bit 2 for CHR accesses) is connected to PRG-ROM A24, and PRG A23 comes from the VT02's I/O port at \$410F, bit 5 instead. Since the I/O port is high-impedance on reset, which is pulled-up to a logical "1", the reset vectors are in the *second* 8 MiB part of ROM.
