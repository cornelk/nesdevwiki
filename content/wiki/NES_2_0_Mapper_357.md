**NES 2.0 Mapper 357** is used for a *4-in-1* multicart (cartridge ID *4602*) from Bit Corp. The first game is Bit Corp's hack of the [YUNG-08](../NES_2.0_Mapper_368/) conversion of *Super Mario Brothers 2 (J)* named *Mr. Mary 2*, the other three games are [UNROM](../UxROM/) games.

Unlike most multicarts, there is no menu; instead, the desired game is selected via two DIP Switches that protrude through the cartridge shell. The DIP switches directly select the outer 128 KiB PRG-ROM bank, game-specific nametable mirroring and mapper mode --- outer bank 0 selects SMB2J mode, all others select [UNROM](../UxROM/) mode. All four games use 8 KiB of unbanked CHR-RAM. Mirroring is Vertical for banks 0-2 and Horizontal for bank 3.

# Banks in SMB2J mode {#Banks_in_SMB2J_mode}

- CPU \$5000-\$5FFF: 4 KiB PRG-ROM bank, fixed to \#16
- CPU \$6000-\$7FFF: 8 KiB PRG-ROM bank, [switchable to \#2 or \#0](#PRG_Bank_Select_2_.28.244120.2C_write.29)
- CPU \$8000-\$9FFF: 8 KiB PRG-ROM bank, fixed to \#1
- CPU \$A000-\$BFFF: 8 KiB PRG-ROM bank, fixed to \#0
- CPU \$C000-\$DFFF: 8 KiB PRG-ROM bank, switchable
- CPU \$E000-\$FFFF: 8 KiB PRG-ROM bank, [switchable to \#10 or \#8](#PRG_Bank_Select_2_.28.244120.2C_write.29)
- PPU \$0000-\$1FFF: unbanked 8 KiB CHR-RAM

When enabled, the 12-bit IRQ counter increases on every M2 cycle until it overflows, upon which an IRQ is fired.
