INES Mapper 250 is a mapper by Nitra, used for pirate games such as [Time Diver Avenger](http://community.fandom.com/wiki/c:bootleggames:Time_Diver:_Avenger) and the Queen Bee V.

Hardware consists of regular MMC3 chip connected in different way:

- A7..A0 is used instead of D7..D0: the value written to each register is the lower byte of the address (i.e. address AND \$00FF), data value is discarded

- Queen Bee V contains also 74153 mux which controls PRG-A13 resulting in the following change:
